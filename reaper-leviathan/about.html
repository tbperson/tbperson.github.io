      <section>
        <p>The Reaper Leviathan is an aggressive leviathan class fauna species usually found swimming in large open areas, such as the Crash Zone, Dunes, and Mountains. One can be found lurking around the base of the mountains island. It is the third-largest aggressive creature in the game and fifth largest overall.
            There are a total of twenty-five Reaper Leviathans in Subnautica: 1 in the bulb zone, 7 in the mountains, 8 in the dunes and 9 in the crash zone. Therefore extreme caution should be taken while exploring those biomes.</p>

        <h1> Appearance</h1>
        <p>The Reaper Leviathan is a massive creature. Fins and mandibles included, the creature is just a little shorter than a Cyclops submarine.

            The Reaper Leviathan possesses a long, slim, muscular body with four caudal fins and two pectoral fins. It also has two dorsal fins running along the length of its entire body, and two ventral fins taking a small portion of its belly. Most of its fins, along with its back, are red in color. The fins and other red areas of the body possess slight bioluminescence.
            
            Its head features a horn (most likely used for ramming its prey), a large mouth housing many teeth, as well as two pairs of eyes with grey sclera. It has two maroon mandibles on each side of its face which have a dark gradient and are tipped with large black claws, four in total. Multiple scars can be seen on the body, particularly around the facial area, and the blueish-white skin appears similar in texture to human skin.</p>

        <h1> Behavior</h1>
        <p>The Reaper Leviathan emits loud, echoing roars audible from great distances. According to the data bank entry, this roar is a form of echolocation, though it does not function like this in-game. It also seems to circle its prey (or more commonly the player) for some time before attacking and often strikes from behind by surprise.

            The Reaper Leviathan often swims deeper down but not quite at the seafloor. Players can use this to their advantage and swim on the surface to avoid detection. It is also less likely to notice the player if they use a Seaglide instead of a submersible.
            
            When the Reaper Leviathan is exposed to damage, it will flinch and roar shortly after being hurt. They won't respawn if killed.</p>

            <h1>Abilities</h1>
            <p>The Reaper Leviathan is capable of taking away 80% of the player's healthbar if they are attacked outside their vehicle. Wearing a Reinforced Dive Suit will reduce damage taken by half, taking 40% damage instead of 80%.

                If the next attack would kill the player, it will hold its victim in its mandibles, pause for a second while roaring, and then proceed to pull the player into its mouth, killing them.
                
                It is also capable of grabbing the Seamoth and shaking it around. Doing so will deal about 40 - 60% damage over eight to thirteen seconds until it lets the vehicle go. However, if hit with the seamoth's Defense System, it will let go instantly. The Reaper Leviathan will also grab the Prawn Suit. If it succeeds, the damage incurred will only be around 20-30%.
                
                Even in Creative Mode, Reaper Leviathans will still jumpscare and grab Seamoths and Prawn Suits.
                
                The Reaper Leviathan has also been observed to grab a Seamoth or Prawn Suit and smash it down to the seabed, destroying it completely afterward.</p>
