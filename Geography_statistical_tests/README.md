# A Level Geography Statistical Tests

This project provides a web-based tool for performing two common statistical tests used in A Level Geography: Spearman's Rank Correlation and Chi-Square Test. The tool is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with support for both light and dark modes.

## Features

- **Spearman's Rank Correlation Calculator**: Allows users to input X and Y values, generate a table, and calculate the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient.
- **Chi-Square Test Calculator**: Allows users to input observed values in a contingency table, generate the table, and calculate the Chi-Square value.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark modes for better readability.

## Usage

1. **Spearman's Rank Correlation**:
    - Enter the number of values (n).
    - Click "Generate Table" to create input fields for X and Y values.
    - Enter the values and click "Calculate" to compute the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient.

2. **Chi-Square Test**:
    - Enter the number of rows and columns for the contingency table.
    - Click "Generate Table" to create input fields for observed values.
    - Enter the observed values and click "Calculate" to compute the Chi-Square value.

## Dark Mode

To toggle dark mode, click the sun/moon icon in the top bar. The page will switch between light and dark themes.
